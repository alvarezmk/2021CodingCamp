1. Get a Slack account and send Ewy your Slack ID to be added to the class Slack channel
  Go to nihncats.slack.com and sign in with NIH credentials
  If you want Slack installed on your desktop, you’ll need to submit an IT ticket (https://myitsm.nih.gov/sp)

2. Get a GitHub account
  Get an account (can use personal or NIH email)
  Send ID to your TA or Ewy so they can add you to the repo with “write” access

3. Select a TA and a project.  Here are some points to consider when selecting a project:
  You only have 8 weeks, and it’ll fly by!  
  Be realistic in what you can achieve and start small (it’s easy enough to scale up)
  Reach out to TAs individually to help with your selection
  This is a great opportunity to work on something you’ve always wanted to but never took the time to do
  If you can line it up with your current work, great!

4. Create a subfolder under your TA’s folder with a short description of your project and a draft timeline of the weeks to come

5. Be ready to talk about your project on Thursday in 2-3 min (one powerpoint slide)
